SUMMARY:
Number of tokens: 202
Number of nodes per file: GOLD:238, CONV:169
File-to-file node mapping:
Out of 238 total GOLD nodes, 123 mapped to CONV => recall    = 51.68%.
Out of 169 total CONV nodes, 123 mapped to GOLD => precision = 72.78%.
 => F₁(GOLD,CONV) = 60.44%.
Before symmetrization, 14 GOLD nodes were projected ambiguously to 30 CONV nodes.
Before symmetrization, 3 CONV nodes were projected ambiguously to 6 GOLD nodes.
Concept and relation comparison (only mapped nodes; unmapped are ignored):
Out of 356 non-empty GOLD values, 181 found in CONV => recall    50.84%.
Out of 311 non-empty CONV values, 181 found in GOLD => precision 58.20%.
 => F₁ = 54.27%.
Concept and relation comparison (for unmapped nodes all counted as incorrect):
Out of 786 non-empty GOLD values, 181 found in CONV => recall    23.03%.
Out of 407 non-empty CONV values, 181 found in GOLD => precision 44.47%.
 => juːmæʧ (GOLD, CONV) = F₁ = 30.34%.
